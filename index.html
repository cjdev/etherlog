      <h2>a backlog tool for agile teams</h2>
      TeamStory is a tool that helps <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">agile teams</a> ...
   <ul>
      <li>maintain a backlog</li>
      <li>communicate with stakeholders</li>
      <li>retrospect</li>
   </ul>

<h2>agile teams</h2>

<p><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile teams</a> value communication over tools and process;  They embrace change. They are constantly improving. 
</p>

But agilists are mortals.  They are good at communicating, good at adapting process to the present, but not good at remembering and number-crunching.

<p>TeamStory takes this to heart, eschewing features that limit project flexibility, focusing instead on making it easy to see the truth and communicate it.</p>

<h2>maintain a backlog</h2>

<p>The backlog is owned by the whole team.  Product owners and team members work together to formulate vague epics, then the team estimates them.  It's always just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Wild-Ass_Guess">silly guess</a> at first.</p>
<p> But, over time, the team works through the project.  Epics are broken-down into more granular stories.  Estimates are honed.  The team gets closer to the truth, the final outcome takes shape.</p>

<p>TeamStory makes it easy to quickly take-down and prioritize epics, make some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Wild-Ass_Guess">silly guesses</a>, and work from there.</p>

     <h2>communicate with stakeholders</h2>

Agile teams adore their stakeholders.  They want them to get frequent and honest project updates, so that the project stays responsive to their needs.

<p>TeamStory makes it easy to see what has changed since the last time a stakeholder has received an update, freeing teams to focus on communicating, collaborating and innovating.</p>

     <h2>retrospect</h2>
<p>Agile Teams regularly set aside time to look back at their recent performance.</p>
<p>TeamStory was built from the ground up to store and replay the complete history of a project, freeing teams to focus on the why instead of the what</p>
