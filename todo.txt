GOALS: 
   1) create a usable place for product owners and teams to maintain a backlog that 
         * keeps ALL backlog history
         * keeps track of multiple different type of non-exclusive estimates (e.g. VP estimates, TL estimates, team estimates)
         * keeps track of how stories were broken-up
   2) make it easy to get the data needed to render graphs
   3) allow backlog editors to edit multiple things at once before "committing" to the outside world (i.e. track changes at an 'editing session' level, rather than a story level)
